//! # Submodule: Basic NDISAPI Structures
//!
//! This submodule provides Rust equivalents of several structures used in the NDISAPI Rust library
//! for communicating with the Windows Packet Filter driver.
//!
//! The structures in this submodule are related to network adapters, Ethernet packets, adapter events,
//! and Remote Access Service (RAS) links.
//!
//! For a detailed description of each structure, refer to their respective documentation within the
//! submodule.
