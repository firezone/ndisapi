//! # Submodule: Basic NDISAPI static filter definitions
//!
//! This submodule contains various structures used for static filters in the NDISAPI Rust library.
//!
//! The `filters` submodule provides a Rust interface for configuring static filters for the Windows Packet
//! Filter driver. It contains structures for specifying filter conditions and actions for various protocols,
//! including Ethernet 802.3, IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, and ICMP. These structures allow users to define complex
//! filtering rules based on multiple packet fields and layers.
//!
//! # Structures
//!
//! * [`Eth8023Filter`] - Represents a static filter for Ethernet 802.3 frames.
//! * [`IpV4Filter`] - Represents a static filter for IPv4 packets.
//! * [`IpV6Filter`] - Represents a static filter for IPv6 packets.
//! * [`TcpUdpFilter`] - Represents a static filter for TCP and UDP packets.
//! * [`IcmpFilter`] - Represents a static filter for ICMP packets.
//! * [`StaticFilter`] - Represents a single static filter entry that combines filter conditions for various
//! layers and the filter action to be taken.
//! * [`StaticFilterTable`] - Represents a table of static filters, used for managing multiple static filter entries.
